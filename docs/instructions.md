Instructions:

Generate a landing page that acts as a slideshow. 

Look at the `/static` folder for some images of the product.
  - `mvp.jpg` is the MVP of the product.
  - `scrap_log.jpg` is the logo

The slides should flow from one another with a smooth **animation**. Turn the wheel logo into a moving gear that moves along the different cnotent slides from differnet angles every time a user clicks right (or left to move backwards).

Follow the general outline stipulated in `info-flow.md`.

The final slide deck must **work as a web application that can be deployed on Vercel**.

Consider #1c1c84 as the navy color scheme and BE CREATIVE
