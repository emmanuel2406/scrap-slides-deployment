Slide 1 — Hook: The Friction of Staying Close

Big Question (full screen):

How often do you journal?
How much friction does it take to call everyone you love?

Then:
	•	You care about n people.
	•	You have t hours per week.
	•	Life gets busy.
	•	Time zones exist.
	•	“We should talk more” becomes… never.

Close with:

What if staying close didn’t require n × daily calls?

⸻

Slide 2 — The Problem: We Forget Our Own Lives

When we finally get on a call:
	•	“What did you do this week?”
	•	Blank.
	•	You forget the small but meaningful moments.
	•	Conversations stay surface-level.

We don’t lack love.
We lack bandwidth and memory.

⸻

Slide 3 — The Insight: Priming Changes Everything

Before meaningful conversation, you need:
	•	A quick recap of your week
	•	A reminder of what actually happened
	•	Something to spark storytelling

We call this priming.

Not journaling for journaling’s sake.
Priming for better human connection.

⸻

Slide 4 — The Solution: Scrap

Scrap is the way to stay in touch with the people you love when you can’t be on the phone every day.

Scrap:
	•	Turns your last 7 days into a concise digest
	•	Optionally lets you record a short video reflection
	•	Makes it easy to share with people who matter

Not a replacement for calling.

A bridge between calls.

⸻

Slide 5 — How It Works (User Flow)
	1.	Open Scrap.
	2.	See your 7-day Priming Summary.
	3.	Record a short reflection (or edit text).
	4.	Share with close contacts.

Now when you talk, you’re already warmed up.
Or they’re already caught up.

⸻

Slide 6 — Under the Hood (Technical Differentiation)

We built:
	•	Google Calendar + Gmail integration (OAuth2)
	•	Optional Messages ingestion via local CLI
	•	A Gemini summarization pipeline
	•	Prompt engineering to ensure:
	•	Bullet-only
	•	No fluff
	•	Under ~15 lines
	•	Phone-screen ready

We dropped third-party AI agents and built our own pipeline.

Result:
Fewer moving parts.
Faster iteration.
Full control.

⸻

Slide 7 — Why This Is Hard (And Why It’s Defensible)

Challenges we solved:
	•	Normalizing time windows across APIs
	•	Designing summaries that are short but meaningful
	•	Managing OAuth across multiple services
	•	Handling latency and partial data gracefully
	•	Structuring a backend/mobile split cleanly

This isn’t just journaling.
It’s structured life condensation.

⸻

Slide 8 — Why Now

Three trends:
	•	AI can meaningfully summarize life streams.
	•	Remote + global families are the norm.
	•	People crave deeper connection but lack time.

We’re not competing with Instagram.
We’re competing with silence.

⸻

Slide 9 — Early Learning

We learned:
	•	Priming is the core product.
	•	People don’t want long journals.
	•	They want something that:
	•	Feels honest
	•	Takes < 2 minutes
	•	Makes them better at staying close

The magic is not recording.
The magic is remembering.

⸻

Slide 10 — Vision

Short term:
	•	Dogfooding with college users
	•	Measure sustained weekly usage
	•	Refine friction to near-zero

Next:
	•	Auto-generate a cinematic weekly mini-movie
	•	One-click export to close contacts
	•	Integrate multi-source condensing tools

Long term:

Scrap becomes your life layer —
quietly structuring your memories
so your relationships stay alive.

⸻

Slide 11 — The Punch

Right now:

If you care about n people
you need roughly n × time to stay close.

Scrap changes the equation.

One weekly reflection.
Shared intentionally.
Conversations that start deeper.

We’re not building another social network.

We’re building infrastructure for love.

Scrap — stay close, even when life gets busy.
